# Each manpage depends on:
# - its .w and .x files and its source script in bin/
# - common.x for the SEE ALSO list
# - lib/Autom4te/ChannelDefs.pm which contains additional --help text
#   (not included in _all_ the manpages, but it's easier to have them
#   all depend on it)
# - .version and configure.ac for version information
#
# We ship the manpages in tarball releases so people can build from
# them without having help2man installed.  For this to work correctly,
# the manpages cannot have declared dependencies on any file that is
# not also shipped in the tarball.  To avoid concurrency bugs, those
# files plus the Makefile must in fact be sufficient to generate the
# manpages.  See the automake manual, section 'Errors with distclean',
# for further discussion.

# To generate the manpages, we use help2man, but we don't have it run
# the built script that corresponds to the manpage.  Instead it runs
# the .w file listed above, which is a wrapper around
# build-aux/help-extract.pl, which parses the *source* of the script
# and extracts the help and version text.  This means that the built
# script doesn't need to exist to create the manpage.  If it did,
# we would have a concurrency bug, since we can't declare a dependency
# on the built script, as discussed above.
# We use a suffix rule describing the manpage as built from its .w file
# so that we can use $(<F) to name the executable to be run, which avoids
# an extra subshell and sed invocation.
