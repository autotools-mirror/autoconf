# This script is not intended to be used directly.  It's run by
# help2man via wrappers in man/, e.g.  man/autoconf.w, as if it were
# one of autoconf's executable scripts.  It extracts the --help and
# --version output of that script from its source form, without
# actually running it.  The script to work from is set by the wrapper,
# and several other parameters are passed down from the Makefile as
# environment variables; see parse_args below.

# The point of this script is, the preprocessed forms of the
# executable scripts, and their wrappers for uninstalled use
# (e.g. <build-dir>/{bin,tests}/autoconf) do not need to exist to
# generate the corresponding manpages.  This is desirable because we
# can't put those dependencies in the makefiles without breaking
# people's ability to build autoconf from a release tarball without
# help2man installed.  It also ensures that we will generate manpages
# from the current source code and not from an older version of the
# script that has already been installed.
